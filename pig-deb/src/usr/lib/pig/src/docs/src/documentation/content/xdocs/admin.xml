<!-- SET UP OUTPUT LOCATION STRICT CHECK -->
    <section>
        <title>Output location strict check</title>
            <p>Pig scripts could contain multiple STORE statements. There are cases when one would like to avoid writing to the same output location. Pig provides admins/script writers with a property to check if multiple STORE statements make an attempt to write to the same output directory. And fail fast letting the user know of the same.</p>
            <p>Specifically this makes sense for file-based output locations (HDFS, Local FS, S3..) to avoid Pig script from failing when multiple MR jobs write to the same location. </p>   
            <p>To enforce strict checking of output location, set <strong>pig.location.check.strict=true</strong>. See also <a href="start.html#properties">Pig Properties</a> on how to set this property.</p>
