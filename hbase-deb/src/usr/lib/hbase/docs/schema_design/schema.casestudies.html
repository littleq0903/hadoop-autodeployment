        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">Hostname</li><li class="listitem">Timestamp</li><li class="listitem">Log event</li><li class="listitem">Value/message</li></ul></div><p>
        We can store them in an HBase table called LOG_DATA, but what will the rowkey be?  
       From these attributes the rowkey will be some combination of hostname, timestamp, and log-event - but what specifically?        
      </p><div class="section" title="1.11.1.1.&nbsp;Timestamp In The Rowkey Lead Position"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="schema.casestudies.log-timeseries.tslead"></a>1.11.1.1.&nbsp;Timestamp In The Rowkey Lead Position</h4></div></div></div><p>The rowkey <code class="code">[timestamp][hostname][log-event]</code> suffers from the monotonically increasing rowkey problem 
        described in <a class="xref" href="rowkey.design.html#timeseries" title="1.3.1.&nbsp; Monotonically Increasing Row Keys/Timeseries Data">Section&nbsp;1.3.1, &#8220;
    Monotonically Increasing Row Keys/Timeseries Data
    &#8221;</a>.
        </p><p>There is another pattern frequently mentioned in the dist-lists about &#8220;bucketing&#8221; timestamps, by performing a mod operation 
        on the timestamp.  If time-oriented scans are important, this could be a useful approach.  Attention must be paid to the number
        of buckets, because this will require the same number of scans to return results.
</p><pre class="programlisting">
long bucket = timestamp % numBuckets;
</pre><p>
        &#8230; to construct:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
[bucket][timestamp][hostname][log-event]
</pre><p>        
          As stated above, to select data for a particular timerange, a Scan will need to be performed for each bucket.  100 buckets,
          for example, will provide a wide distribution in the keyspace but it will require 100 Scans to obtain data for a single
          timestamp, so there are trade-offs. 
        </p></div><div class="section" title="1.11.1.2.&nbsp;Host In The Rowkey Lead Position"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="schema.casestudies.log-timeseries.hostlead"></a>1.11.1.2.&nbsp;Host In The Rowkey Lead Position</h4></div></div></div><p>The rowkey <code class="code">[hostname][log-event][timestamp]</code> is a candidate if there is a large-ish number of hosts to spread
        the writes and reads across the keyspace.  This approach would be useful if scanning by hostname was a priority.
        </p></div><div class="section" title="1.11.1.3.&nbsp;Timestamp, or Reverse Timestamp?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="schema.casestudies.log-timeseries.revts"></a>1.11.1.3.&nbsp;Timestamp, or Reverse Timestamp?</h4></div></div></div><p>If the most important access path is to pull most recent events, then storing the timestamps as reverse-timestamps 
        (e.g., <code class="code">timestamp = Long.MAX_VALUE &#8211; timestamp</code>) will create the property of being able to do a Scan on
        <code class="code">[hostname][log-event]</code> to obtain the quickly obtain the most recently captured events.
        </p><p>Neither approach is wrong, it just depends on what is most appropriate for the situation.
        </p></div><div class="section" title="1.11.1.4.&nbsp;Variangle Length or Fixed Length Rowkeys?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="schema.casestudies.log-timeseries.varkeys"></a>1.11.1.4.&nbsp;Variangle Length or Fixed Length Rowkeys?</h4></div></div></div><p>It is critical to remember that rowkeys are stamped on every column in HBase.  If the hostname is &#8220;a&#8221; and the event type
         is &#8220;e1&#8221; then the resulting rowkey would be quite small.  However, what if the ingested hostname is
          &#8220;myserver1.mycompany.com&#8221; and the event type is &#8220;com.package1.subpackage2.subsubpackage3.ImportantService&#8221;?  
         </p><p>It might make sense to use some substitution in the rowkey.  There are at least two approaches:  hashed and numeric.
         In the Hostname In The Rowkey Lead Position example, it might look like this:
        </p><p>Composite Rowkey With Hashes:  
           </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">[MD5 hash of hostname] = 16 bytes</li><li class="listitem">[MD5 hash of event-type] = 16 bytes</li><li class="listitem">[timestamp] = 8 bytes</li></ul></div><p>
        </p><p>Composite Rowkey With Numeric Substitution: 
        </p><p>For this approach another lookup table would be needed in addition to LOG_DATA, called LOG_TYPES.  
        The rowkey of LOG_TYPES would be:
		  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">[type]  (e.g., byte indicating hostname vs. event-type)</li><li class="listitem">[bytes]  variable length bytes for raw hostname or event-type.</li></ul></div><p>
        A column for this rowkey could be a long with an assigned number, which could be obtained by using an 
		<a class="link" href="http://hbase.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/client/HTable.html#incrementColumnValue%28byte[],%20byte[],%20byte[],%20long%29" target="_top">HBase counter</a>.
        </p><p>So the resulting composite rowkey would be:
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">[substituted long for hostname] = 8 bytes</li><li class="listitem">[substituted long for event type] = 8 bytes</li><li class="listitem">[timestamp] = 8 bytes</li></ul></div><p>
		In either the Hash or Numeric substitution approach, the raw values for hostname and event-type can be stored as columns.
        </p></div></div><div class="section" title="1.11.2.&nbsp;Case Study - Log Data and Timeseries Data on Steroids"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="schema.casestudies.log-steroids"></a>1.11.2.&nbsp;Case Study - Log Data and Timeseries Data on Steroids</h3></div></div></div><p>This effectively is the OpenTSDB approach.  What OpenTSDB does is re-write data and pack rows into columns for 
        certain time-periods.  For a detailed explanation, see:  <a class="link" href="http://opentsdb.net/schema.html" target="_top">http://opentsdb.net/schema.html</a>, 
        and <a class="link" href="http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/resources/library/hbasecon/video-hbasecon-2012-lessons-learned-from-opentsdb.html" target="_top">Lessons Learned from OpenTSDB</a>
	    from HBaseCon2012.
      </p><p>But this is how the general concept works:  data is ingested, for example, in this manner&#8230;
</p><pre class="programlisting">
[hostname][log-event][timestamp1]
[hostname][log-event][timestamp2]
[hostname][log-event][timestamp3]
</pre><p>
       &#8230; with separate rowkeys for each detailed event, but is re-written like this&#8230; 
       </p><p><code class="code">[hostname][log-event][timerange]</code>
       </p><p>&#8230; and each of the above events are converted into columns stored with a time-offset relative to the beginning timerange 
       (e.g., every 5 minutes).  This is obviously a very advanced processing technique, but HBase makes this possible.
      </p></div><div class="section" title="1.11.3.&nbsp;Case Study - Customer/Order"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="schema.casestudies.custorder"></a>1.11.3.&nbsp;Case Study - Customer/Order</h3></div></div></div><p>Assume that HBase is used to store customer and order information.  There are two core record-types being ingested:  
        a Customer record type, and Order record type.
      </p><p>The Customer record type would include all the things that you&#8217;d typically expect:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">Customer number</li><li class="listitem">Customer name</li><li class="listitem">Address (e.g., city, state, zip)</li><li class="listitem">Phone numbers, etc.</li></ul></div><p>
     </p><p>The Order record type would include things like:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">Customer number</li><li class="listitem">Order number</li><li class="listitem">Sales date</li><li class="listitem">A series of nested objects for shipping locations and line-items (see <a class="xref" href="schema.casestudies.html#schema.casestudies.custorder.obj" title="1.11.3.2.&nbsp;Order Object Design">Section&nbsp;1.11.3.2, &#8220;Order Object Design&#8221;</a>
           for details)</li></ul></div><p>
    </p><p>Assuming that the combination of customer number and sales order uniquely identify an order, these two attributes will compose
 the rowkey, and specifically a composite key such as:
    </p><p><code class="code">[customer number][order number]</code>
    </p><p>&#8230; for a ORDER table.  However, there are more design decisions to make:  are the <span class="emphasis"><em>raw</em></span> values the best choices for rowkeys?
    </p><p>The same design questions in the Log Data use-case confront us here.  What is the keyspace of the customer number, and what is the 
format (e.g., numeric?  alphanumeric?) As it is advantageous to use fixed-length keys in HBase, as well as keys that can support a 
reasonable spread in the keyspace, similar options appear:
    </p><p>Composite Rowkey With Hashes:  
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">[MD5 of customer number] = 16 bytes</li><li class="listitem">[MD5 of order number] = 16 bytes</li></ul></div><p>
    </p><p>Composite Numeric/Hash Combo Rowkey: 
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">[substituted long for customer number] = 8 bytes</li><li class="listitem">[MD5 of order number] = 16 bytes</li></ul></div><p>
     </p><div class="section" title="1.11.3.1.&nbsp;Single Table? Multiple Tables?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="schema.casestudies.custorder.tables"></a>1.11.3.1.&nbsp;Single Table?  Multiple Tables?</h4></div></div></div><p>A traditional design approach would have separate tables for CUSTOMER and SALES.  Another option is to pack multiple 
            record types into a single table (e.g., CUSTOMER++).            
            </p><p>Customer Record Type Rowkey:
              </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">[customer-id]</li><li class="listitem">[type] = type indicating &#8216;1&#8217; for customer record type</li></ul></div><p>
            </p><p>Order Record Type Rowkey:
              </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">[customer-id]</li><li class="listitem">[type] = type indicating &#8216;2&#8217; for order record type</li><li class="listitem">[order]</li></ul></div><p>
            </p><p>The advantage of this particular CUSTOMER++ approach is that organizes many different record-types by customer-id 
            (e.g., a single scan could get you everything about that customer).  The disadvantage is that it&#8217;s not as easy to scan for
            a particular record-type.
            </p></div><div class="section" title="1.11.3.2.&nbsp;Order Object Design"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="schema.casestudies.custorder.obj"></a>1.11.3.2.&nbsp;Order Object Design</h4></div></div></div><p>Now we need to address how to model the Order object.  Assume that the class structure is as follows:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
<code class="filename">Order</code>
     <code class="filename">ShippingLocation</code>     (an Order can have multiple ShippingLocations)
          <code class="filename">LineItem</code>               (a ShippingLocation can have multiple LineItems)
</pre><p>
	       ... there are multiple options on storing this data.
	      </p><div class="section" title="1.11.3.2.1.&nbsp;Completely Normalized"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="schema.casestudies.custorder.obj.norm"></a>1.11.3.2.1.&nbsp;Completely Normalized</h5></div></div></div><p>With this approach, there would be separate tables for ORDER, SHIPPING_LOCATION, and LINE_ITEM.          
	        </p><p>The ORDER table's rowkey was described above: <a class="xref" href="schema.casestudies.html#schema.casestudies.custorder" title="1.11.3.&nbsp;Case Study - Customer/Order">Section&nbsp;1.11.3, &#8220;Case Study - Customer/Order&#8221;</a>
	        </p><p>The SHIPPING_LOCATION's composite rowkey would be something like this:
	          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">[order-rowkey]</li><li class="listitem">[shipping location number] (e.g., 1st location, 2nd, etc.)</li></ul></div><p>
	        </p><p>The LINE_ITEM table's composite rowkey would be something like this:
	          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">[order-rowkey]</li><li class="listitem">[shipping location number] (e.g., 1st location, 2nd, etc.)</li><li class="listitem">[line item number] (e.g., 1st lineitem, 2nd, etc.)</li></ul></div><p>
	        </p><p>Such a normalized model is likely to be the approach with an RDBMS, but that's not your only option with HBase.
	        The cons of such an approach is that to retrieve information about any Order, you will need:
	          </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">Get on the ORDER table for the Order</li><li class="listitem">Scan on the SHIPPING_LOCATION table for that order to get the ShippingLocation instances</li><li class="listitem">Scan on the LINE_ITEM for each ShippingLocation</li></ul></div><p>
	          ... granted, this is what an RDBMS would do under the covers anyway, but since there are no joins in HBase
	          you're just more aware of this fact.

	        </p><p>The pros of this approach include a less complex object heirarchy, but one of the cons is that updating gets more

For example, the

	        single column called "order" would contain an object that could be deserialized that contained a container Order, 
	        ShippingLocations, and LineItems.
	        </p><p>There are many options here:  JSON, XML, Java Serialization, Avro, Hadoop Writables, etc.  All of them are variants
	        of the same approach:  encode the object graph to a byte-array.  Care should be taken with this approach to ensure backward 
	        compatibilty in case the object model changes such that older persisted structures can still be read back out of HBase.
	        </p><p>Pros are being able to manage complex object graphs with minimal I/O (e.g., a single HBase Get per
	        Order in this example), but the cons include the aforementioned warning about backward compatiblity of serialization,
	        language dependencies of serialization (e.g., Java Serialization only works with Java clients), the fact that
	        you have to deserialize the entire object to get any piece of information inside the BLOB, and the difficulty in 
	        getting frameworks like Hive to work with custom objects like this.

	    OpenTSDB is the best example of this case where a single row represents a defined time-range, and then discrete events are treated as

    		</p><p>*** QUESTION ***</p><p>
    		We're looking at how to store a large amount of (per-user) list data in
HBase, and we were trying to figure out what kind of access pattern made
the most sense.  One option is store the majority of the data in a key, so
we could have something like:
    		</p><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;FixedWidthUserName&gt;&lt;FixedWidthValueId1&gt;:"" (no value)
&lt;FixedWidthUserName&gt;&lt;FixedWidthValueId2&gt;:"" (no value)
&lt;FixedWidthUserName&gt;&lt;FixedWidthValueId3&gt;:"" (no value)
			</pre>

The other option we had was to do this entirely using:
    		<pre class="programlisting">
&lt;FixedWidthUserName&gt;&lt;FixedWidthPageNum0&gt;:&lt;FixedWidthLength&gt;&lt;FixedIdNextPageNum&gt;&lt;ValueId1&gt;&lt;ValueId2&gt;&lt;ValueId3&gt;...
&lt;FixedWidthUserName&gt;&lt;FixedWidthPageNum1&gt;:&lt;FixedWidthLength&gt;&lt;FixedIdNextPageNum&gt;&lt;ValueId1&gt;&lt;ValueId2&gt;&lt;ValueId3&gt;...
    		</pre><p>
where each row would contain multiple values.
So in one case reading the first thirty values would be:
			</p><pre class="programlisting">
scan { STARTROW =&gt; 'FixedWidthUsername' LIMIT =&gt; 30}
    		</pre>
And in the second case it would be
    		<pre class="programlisting">
get 'FixedWidthUserName\x00\x00\x00\x00'
    		</pre><p>
The general usage pattern would be to read only the first 30 values of
these lists, with infrequent access reading deeper into the lists.  Some
users would have &lt;= 30 total values in these lists, and some users would
have millions (i.e. power-law distribution)
			</p><p>
 The single-value format seems like it would take up more space on HBase,
but would offer some improved retrieval / pagination flexibility.  Would
there be any significant performance advantages to be able to paginate via
gets vs paginating with scans?
			</p><p>
  My initial understanding was that doing a scan should be faster if our
paging size is unknown (and caching is set appropriately), but that gets
should be faster if we'll always need the same page size.  I've ended up
hearing different people tell me opposite things about performance.  I
assume the page sizes would be relatively consistent, so for most use cases
we could guarantee that we only wanted one page of data in the
fixed-page-length case.  I would also assume that we would have infrequent
updates, but may have inserts into the middle of these lists (meaning we'd
need to update all subsequent rows).
			</p><p>
Thanks for help / suggestions / follow-up questions.
			</p><p>*** ANSWER ***</p><p>
If I understand you correctly, you're ultimately trying to store
triples in the form "user, valueid, value", right? E.g., something
like:
			</p><pre class="programlisting">
"user123, firstname, Paul",
"user234, lastname, Smith"
			</pre><p>
(But the usernames are fixed width, and the valueids are fixed width).
			</p><p>
And, your access pattern is along the lines of: "for user X, list the
next 30 values, starting with valueid Y". Is that right? And these
values should be returned sorted by valueid?
			</p><p>
The tl;dr version is that you should probably go with one row per
user+value, and not build a complicated intra-row pagination scheme on
your own unless you're really sure it is needed.
			</p><p>
Your two options mirror a common question people have when designing
HBase schemas: should I go "tall" or "wide"? Your first schema is
"tall": each row represents one value for one user, and so there are
many rows in the table for each user; the row key is user + valueid,
and there would be (presumably) a single column qualifier that means
"the value". This is great if you want to scan over rows in sorted
order by row key (thus my question above, about whether these ids are
sorted correctly). You can start a scan at any user+valueid, read the
next 30, and be done. What you're giving up is the ability to have
transactional guarantees around all the rows for one user, but it
doesn't sound like you need that. Doing it this way is generally
recommended (see
here <a class="link" href="http://hbase.apache.org/book.html#schema.smackdown" target="_top">http://hbase.apache.org/book.html#schema.smackdown</a>).
			</p><p>
Your second option is "wide": you store a bunch of values in one row,
using different qualifiers (where the qualifier is the valueid). The
simple way to do that would be to just store ALL values for one user
in a single row. I'm guessing you jumped to the "paginated" version
because you're assuming that storing millions of columns in a single
row would be bad for performance, which may or may not be true; as
long as you're not trying to do too much in a single request, or do
things like scanning over and returning all of the cells in the row,
it shouldn't be fundamentally worse. The client has methods that allow
you to get specific slices of columns.
			</p><p>
Note that neither case fundamentally uses more disk space than the
other; you're just "shifting" part of the identifying information for
a value either to the left (into the row key, in option one) or to the
right (into the column qualifiers in option 2). Under the covers,
every key/value still stores the whole row key, and column family
name. (If this is a bit confusing, take an hour and watch Lars
George's excellent video about understanding HBase schema design:
<a class="link" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HLoH_PgrLk)" target="_top">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HLoH_PgrLk)</a>.
			</p><p>
A manually paginated version has lots more complexities, as you note,
like having to keep track of how many things are in each page,
re-shuffling if new values are inserted, etc. That seems significantly
more complex. It might have some slight speed advantages (or
disadvantages!) at extremely high throughput, and the only way to
really know that would be to try it out. If you don't have time to
build it both ways and compare, my advice would be to start with the
simplest option (one row per user+value). Start simple and iterate! :)
