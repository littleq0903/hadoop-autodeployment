Routine MapReduce 
         jobs run against HBase tables which regularly completed in five or six minutes began taking 30 or 40 minutes 
         to finish. These jobs were consistently found to be waiting on map and reduce tasks assigned to the troubled data node 
         (e.g., the slow map tasks all had the same Input Split).           
         The situation came to a head during a distributed copy, when the copy was severely prolonged by the lagging node.

		  where uneven key-space distribution can funnel a huge number of requests to a single HBase region, bombarding the RegionServer 
		  process and cause slow response time. Examination of the HBase Master status page showed that the number of HBase requests to the 
		  troubled node was almost zero.  Further, examination of the HBase logs showed that there were no region splits, compactions, or other region transitions 
		  in progress.  This effectively ruled out a "hot spot" as the root cause of the observed slowness.

		  forcing HDFS to request data blocks from other servers over the network.  Examination of the datanode logs showed that there were very 
		  few blocks being requested over the network, indicating that the HBase region was correctly assigned, and that the majority of the necessary 
		  data was located on the node. This ruled out the possibility of non-local data causing a slowdown.

          Java, by design, will periodically scan its entire memory space to do garbage collection.  If system memory is heavily overcommitted, the Linux 
          kernel may enter a vicious cycle, using up all of its resources swapping Java heap back and forth from disk to RAM as Java tries to run garbage 
          collection.  Further, a failing hard disk will often retry reads and/or writes many times before giving up and returning an error. This can manifest 
          as high iowait, as running processes wait for reads and writes to complete.  Finally, a disk nearing the upper edge of its performance envelope will 
          begin to cause iowait as it informs the kernel that it cannot accept any more data, and the kernel queues incoming data into the dirty write pool in memory.  
          However, using <code class="code">vmstat(1)</code> and <code class="code">free(1)</code>, we could see that no swap was being used, and the amount of disk IO was only a few kilobytes per second.
          </p></div><div class="section" title="1.3.1.3.4.&nbsp;Slowness Due To High Processor Usage"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a name="d6165e82"></a>1.3.1.3.4.&nbsp;Slowness Due To High Processor Usage</h5></div></div></div><p>Next, we checked to see whether the system was performing slowly simply due to very high computational load.  <code class="code">top(1)</code> showed that the system load 
          was higher than normal, but <code class="code">vmstat(1)</code> and <code class="code">mpstat(1)</code> showed that the amount of processor being used for actual computation was low.

The datanode had two 
          gigabit ethernet adapters, bonded to form an active-standby interface.  <code class="code">ifconfig(8)</code> showed some unusual anomalies, namely interface errors, overruns, framing errors. 
          While not unheard of, these kinds of errors are exceedingly rare on modern hardware which is operating as it should:

          </p><p>These errors immediately lead us to suspect that one or more of the ethernet interfaces might have negotiated the wrong line speed.  This was confirmed both by running an ICMP ping 
          from an external host and observing round-trip-time in excess of 700ms, and by running <code class="code">ethtool(8)</code> on the members of the bond interface and discovering that the active interface 
          was operating at 100Mbs/, full duplex.
