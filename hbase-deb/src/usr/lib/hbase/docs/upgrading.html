            Since we came up out of hadoop itself, we originally tracked hadoop versioning.
            Later we left hadoop versioning behind because we were moving at a different rate
            to that of our parent.  If you are into the arcane, checkout our old wiki page
            on <a class="link" href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hbase/HBaseVersions" target="_top">HBase Versioning</a>
            which tries to connect the HBase version dots.</p><div class="section" title="1.1.1.&nbsp;Odd/Even Versioning or &#34;Development&#34;&#34; Series Releases"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="hbase.development.series"></a>1.1.1.&nbsp;Odd/Even Versioning or "Development"" Series Releases</h3></div></div></div><p>Ahead of big releases, we have been putting up preview versions to start the
                feedback cycle turning-over  earlier.  These "Development" Series releases,
                always odd-numbered, come with no guarantees, not even regards being able
                to upgrade between two sequential releases (we reserve the right to break compatibility across
                "Development" Series releases).  Needless to say, these releases are not for
                production deploys.  They are a preview of what is coming in the hope that
                interested parties will take the release for a test drive and flag us early if we
                there are issues we've missed ahead of our rolling a production-worthy release.
            </p><p>Our first "Development" Series was the 0.89 set that came out ahead of
                HBase 0.90.0.  HBase 0.95 is another "Development" Series that portends
                HBase 0.96.0.

                are wire and binary compatible.  Compatible HBase versions means that
                clients can talk to compatible but differently versioned servers.
                It means too that you can just swap out the jars of one version and replace
                them with the jars of another, compatible version and all will just work.
                Unless otherwise specified, HBase point versions are binary compatible.
                You can safely do rolling upgrades between binary compatible versions; i.e.
                across point versions: e.g. from 0.94.5 to 0.94.6<sup>[<a name="d5160e34" href="#ftn.d5160e34" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup>.

                you can do a rolling upgrade between hbase point versions;
                for example, you can go to 0.94.6 from 0.94.5 by doing a rolling upgrade across the cluster
                replacing the 0.94.5 binary with a 0.94.6 binary.

             In the above sample output, there are two HFileV1 in two regions, and one corrupt file.
             Corrupt files should probably be removed.  The regions that have HFileV1s need to be major
             compacted.  To major compact, start up the hbase shell and review how to compact an individual
             region.  After the major compaction is done, rerun the check step and the HFileV1s shoudl be
             gone, replaced by HFileV2 instances.

             The above command would detect HFileV1s in the /myHBase/testTable directory.

             Once the check step reports all the HFileV1 files have been rewritten, it is safe to proceed with the

memstore has zero or just a few small elements.  This is fine usually but if you had lots of regions per regionserver in a 0.90.x cluster (and MSLAB was off),
you may find yourself OOME'ing on upgrade because the <span class="mathphrase">thousands of regions * number of column families * 2MB MSLAB (at a minimum)</span>
puts your heap over the top.  Set <code class="varname">hbase.hregion.memstore.mslab.enabled</code> to
<code class="constant">false</code> or set the MSLAB size down from 2MB by setting <code class="varname">hbase.hregion.memstore.mslab.chunksize</code> to something less.

In 0.92.0, log splitting is done by the cluster (See See &#8220;HBASE-1364 [performance] Distributed splitting of regionserver commit logs&#8221;).  This should cut down significantly on the amount of time it takes splitting logs and getting regions back online again.

In 0.90.x, the HFile v1 indices lived outside of the LRU so they took up space even if the index was on a &#8216;cold&#8217; file, one that wasn&#8217;t being actively used.  With the indices now in the LRU, you may find you
have less space for block caching.  Adjust your block cache accordingly.  See the <a class="xref" href="#">???</a> for more detail.
The block size default size has been changed in 0.92.0 from 0.2 (20 percent of heap) to 0.25.

A new cache was contributed to 0.92.0 to act as a solution between using the &#8220;on-heap&#8221; cache which is the current LRU cache the region servers have and the operating system cache which is out of our control.
To enable <span class="emphasis"><em>SlabCache</em></span>, as this feature is being called, set &#8220;-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize&#8221; in hbase-env.sh to the value for maximum direct memory size and specify
<span class="property">hbase.offheapcache.percentage</span> in <code class="filename">hbase-site.xml</code> with the percentage that you want to dedicate to off-heap cache. This should only be set for servers and not for clients. Use at your own risk.
See this blog post, <a class="link" href="http://www.cloudera.com/blog/2012/01/caching-in-hbase-slabcache/" target="_top">Caching in Apache HBase: SlabCache</a>, for additional information on this new experimental feature.

</h3></div></div></div><p>0.92.0 adds two new features: multi-slave and multi-master replication. The way to enable this is the same as adding a new peer, so in order to have multi-master you would just run add_peer for each cluster that acts as a master to the other slave clusters. Collisions are handled at the timestamp level which may or may not be what you want, this needs to be evaluated on a per use case basis. Replication is still experimental in 0.92 and is disabled by default, run it at your own risk.

Previous, a RegionServer might stick around after incurring an OOME limping along in some wounded state.  To disable this facility, and recommend you leave it in place, you&#8217;d need to edit the bin/hbase file.  Look for the addition of the -XX:OnOutOfMemoryError="kill -9 %p" arguments (See [HBASE-4769] - &#8216;Abort RegionServer Immediately on OOME&#8217;)

</h3></div></div></div><p>0.92.0 stores data in a new format, <a class="xref" href="#">???</a>.   As HBase runs, it will move all your data from HFile v1 to HFile v2 format.  This auto-migration will run in the background as flushes and compactions run.
HFile V2 allows HBase run with larger regions/files.  In fact, we encourage that all HBasers going forward tend toward Facebook axiom #1, run with larger, fewer regions.
If you have lots of regions now -- more than 100s per host -- you should look into setting your region size up after you move to 0.92.0 (In 0.92.0, default size is now 1G, up from 256M), and then running online merge tool (See &#8220;HBASE-1621 merge tool should work on online cluster, but disabled table&#8221;).

              HBase 0.20.x or HBase 0.89.x.  There is no need of a migration step.
              HBase 0.89.x and 0.90.x does write out the name of region directories
              differently -- it names them with a md5 hash of the region name rather
              than a jenkins hash -- so this means that once started, there is no
              going back to HBase 0.20.x.
          </p><p>
             Be sure to remove the <code class="filename">hbase-default.xml</code> from
             your <code class="filename">conf</code>
             directory on upgrade.  A 0.20.x version of this file will have
             sub-optimal configurations for 0.90.x HBase.  The
             <code class="filename">hbase-default.xml</code> file is now bundled into the
             HBase jar and read from there.  If you would like to review
             the content of this file, see it in the src tree at
             <code class="filename">src/main/resources/hbase-default.xml</code> or
             see <a class="xref" href="#">???</a>.
          </p><p>
            Finally, if upgrading from 0.20.x, check your
            <code class="varname">.META.</code> schema in the shell.  In the past we would
            recommend that users run with a 16kb
            <code class="varname">MEMSTORE_FLUSHSIZE</code>.
            Run <code class="code">hbase&gt; scan '-ROOT-'</code> in the shell. This will output
            the current <code class="varname">.META.</code> schema.  Check
            <code class="varname">MEMSTORE_FLUSHSIZE</code> size.  Is it 16kb (16384)?  If so, you will
            need to change this (The 'normal'/default value is 64MB (67108864)).
            Run the script <code class="filename">bin/set_meta_memstore_size.rb</code>.
            This will make the necessary edit to your <code class="varname">.META.</code> schema.
            Failure to run this change will make for a slow cluster <sup>[<a name="d5160e378" href="#ftn.d5160e378" class="footnote">2</a>]</sup>
