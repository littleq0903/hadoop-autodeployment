  </h2></div></div></div><p>
      HBase currently does not do well with anything above two or three column families so keep the number
      of column families in your schema low.  Currently, flushing and compactions are done on a per Region basis so
      if one column family is carrying the bulk of the data bringing on flushes, the adjacent families
      will also be flushed though the amount of data they carry is small.  When many column families the
      flushing and compaction interaction can make for a bunch of needless i/o loading (To be addressed by
      changing flushing and compaction to work on a per column family basis).  For more information
      on compactions, see <a class="xref" href="#">???</a>.
    </p><p>Try to make do with one column family if you can in your schemas.  Only introduce a
        second and third column family in the case where data access is usually column scoped;
        i.e. you query one column family or the other but usually not both at the one time.

      If ColumnFamilyA has 1 million rows and ColumnFamilyB has 1 billion rows, ColumnFamilyA's data will likely be spread
      across many, many regions (and RegionServers).  This makes mass scans for ColumnFamilyA less efficient.

    Monotonically Increasing Row Keys/Timeseries Data
    </h3></div></div></div><p>
      In the HBase chapter of Tom White's book Hadoop: The Definitive Guide (O'Reilly) there is a an optimization note on watching out for a phenomenon where an import process walks in lock-step with all clients in concert pounding one of the table's regions (and thus, a single node), then moving onto the next region, etc.  With monotonically increasing row-keys (i.e., using a timestamp), this will happen.  See this comic by IKai Lan on why monotonically increasing row keys are problematic in BigTable-like datastores:
      <a class="link" href="http://ikaisays.com/2011/01/25/app-engine-datastore-tip-monotonically-increasing-values-are-bad/" target="_top">monotonically increasing values are bad</a>.  The pile-up on a single region brought on
      by monotonically increasing keys can be mitigated by randomizing the input records to not be in sorted order, but in general it's best to avoid using a timestamp or a sequence (e.g. 1, 2, 3) as the row-key.
    </p><p>If you do need to upload time series data into HBase, you should
    study <a class="link" href="http://opentsdb.net/" target="_top">OpenTSDB</a> as a
    successful example.  It has a page describing the <a class="link" href=" http://opentsdb.net/schema.html" target="_top">schema</a> it uses in
    HBase.  The key format in OpenTSDB is effectively [metric_type][event_timestamp], which would appear at first glance to contradict the previous advice about not using a timestamp as the key.  However, the difference is that the timestamp is not in the <span class="emphasis"><em>lead</em></span> position of the key, and the design assumption is that there are dozens or hundreds (or more) of different metric types.  Thus, even with a continual stream of input data with a mix of metric types, the Puts are distributed across various points of regions in the table.
   </p><p>See <a class="xref" href="#schema.casestudies" title="1.11.&nbsp;Schema Design Case Studies">Section&nbsp;1.11, &#8220;Schema Design Case Studies&#8221;</a> for some rowkey design examples.
   </p></div><div class="section" title="1.3.2.&nbsp;Try to minimize row and column sizes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="keysize"></a>1.3.2.&nbsp;Try to minimize row and column sizes</h3></div><div><h4 class="subtitle">Or why are my StoreFile indices large?</h4></div></div></div><p>In HBase, values are always freighted with their coordinates; as a
          cell value passes through the system, it'll be accompanied by its
          row, column name, and timestamp - always.  If your rows and column names
          are large, especially compared to the size of the cell value, then
          you may run up against some interesting scenarios.  One such is
          the case described by Marc Limotte at the tail of
          HBASE-3551
          (recommended!).
          Therein, the indices that are kept on HBase storefiles (<a class="xref" href="#">???</a>)
                  to facilitate random access may end up occupyng large chunks of the HBase
                  allotted RAM because the cell value coordinates are large.
                  Mark in the above cited comment suggests upping the block size so
                  entries in the store file index happen at a larger interval or
                  modify the table schema so it makes for smaller rows and column
                  names.
                  Compression will also make for larger indices.  See
                  the thread <a class="link" href="http://search-hadoop.com/m/hemBv1LiN4Q1/a+question+storefileIndexSize&amp;subj=a+question+storefileIndexSize" target="_top">a question storefileIndexSize</a>

       </p><p>Most of the time small inefficiencies don't matter all that much.  Unfortunately,
         this is a case where they do.  Whatever patterns are selected for ColumnFamilies, attributes, and rowkeys they could be repeated

         A short key that is useless for data access is not better than a longer key with better get/scan properties.  Expect tradeoffs
         when designing rowkeys.

You can store an unsigned number up to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 in those eight bytes.
            If you stored this number as a String -- presuming a byte per character -- you need nearly 3x the bytes.
         </p><p>Not convinced?  Below is some sample code that you can run on your own.
</p><pre class="programlisting">
// long
//
long l = 1234567890L;
byte[] lb = Bytes.toBytes(l);
System.out.println("long bytes length: " + lb.length);   // returns 8

String s = "" + l;
byte[] sb = Bytes.toBytes(s);
System.out.println("long as string length: " + sb.length);    // returns 10

// hash
//
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5");
byte[] digest = md.digest(Bytes.toBytes(s));
System.out.println("md5 digest bytes length: " + digest.length);    // returns 16

String sDigest = new String(digest);
byte[] sbDigest = Bytes.toBytes(sDigest);
System.out.println("md5 digest as string length: " + sbDigest.length);    // returns 26
</pre><p>
         </p><p>Unfortunately, using a binary representation of a type will make your data harder to read outside of your code. For example,
               this is what you will see in the shell when you increment a value:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
hbase(main):001:0&gt; incr 't', 'r', 'f:q', 1
COUNTER VALUE = 1

hbase(main):002:0&gt; get 't', 'r'
COLUMN                                        CELL
 f:q                                          timestamp=1369163040570, value=\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x01
1 row(s) in 0.0310 seconds
</pre><p>
               The shell makes a best effort to print a string, and it this case it decided to just print the hex. The same will
               happen to your row keys inside the region names. It can be okay if you know what's being stored, but it might also
               be unreadable if arbitrary data can be put in the same cells. This is the main trade-off.
         </p></div></div><div class="section" title="1.3.3.&nbsp;Reverse Timestamps"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="reverse.timestamp"></a>1.3.3.&nbsp;Reverse Timestamps</h3></div></div></div><p>A common problem in database processing is quickly finding the most recent version of a value.  A technique using reverse timestamps
    as a part of the key can help greatly with a special case of this problem.  Also found in the HBase chapter of Tom White's book Hadoop:  The Definitive Guide (O'Reilly),
    the technique involves appending (<code class="code">Long.MAX_VALUE - timestamp</code>) to the end of any key, e.g., [key][reverse_timestamp].
    </p><p>The most recent value for [key] in a table can be found by performing a Scan for [key] and obtaining the first record.  Since HBase keys
    are in sorted order, this key sorts before any older row-keys for [key] and thus is first.
    </p><p>This technique would be used instead of using <a class="xref" href="#schema.versions" title="1.4.&nbsp; Number of Versions">Section&nbsp;1.4, &#8220;
  Number of Versions
  &#8221;</a> where the intent is to hold onto all versions
    "forever" (or a very long time) and at the same time quickly obtain access to any other version by using the same Scan technique.

The only way they can be "changed" in a table is if the row is deleted and then re-inserted.

    lead position of the key (e.g., ""0000000000000000" to "ffffffffffffffff").  Running those key ranges through <code class="code">Bytes.split</code>
    (which is the split strategy used when creating regions in <code class="code">HBaseAdmin.createTable(byte[] startKey, byte[] endKey, numRegions)</code>

    ... (note:  the lead byte is listed to the right as a comment.)  Given that the first split is a '0' and the last split is an 'f',
    everything is great, right?  Not so fast.
    </p><p>The problem is that all the data is going to pile up in the first 2 regions and the last region thus creating a "lumpy" (and
    possibly "hot") region problem.  To understand why, refer to an  <a class="link" href="http://www.asciitable.com" target="_top">ASCII Table</a>.
    '0' is byte 48, and 'f' is byte 102, but there is a huge gap in byte values (bytes 58 to 96) that will <span class="emphasis"><em>never appear in this
    keyspace</em></span> because the only values are [0-9] and [a-f].  Thus, the middle regions regions will
    never be used.  To make pre-spliting work with this example keyspace, a custom definition of splits (i.e., and not relying on the
    built-in split method) is required.
    </p><p>Lesson #1:  Pre-splitting tables is generally a best practice, but you need to pre-split them in such a way that all the
    regions are accessible in the keyspace.  While this example demonstrated the problem with a hex-key keyspace, the same problem can happen
     with <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> keyspace.  Know your data.
    </p><p>Lesson #2:  While generally not advisable, using hex-keys (and more generally, displayable data) can still work with pre-split
    tables as long as all the created regions are accessible in the keyspace.
    </p><p>To conclude this example, the following is an example of  how appropriate splits can be pre-created for hex-keys:.

  </h2></div></div></div><p>This section could also be titled "what if my table rowkey looks like <span class="emphasis"><em>this</em></span> but I also want to query my table like <span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span>."
  A common example on the dist-list is where a row-key is of the format "user-timestamp" but there are reporting requirements on activity across users for certain
  time ranges.  Thus, selecting by user is easy because it is in the lead position of the key, but time is not.
  </p><p>There is no single answer on the best way to handle this because it depends on...
   </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">Number of users</li><li class="listitem">Data size and data arrival rate</li><li class="listitem">Flexibility of reporting requirements (e.g., completely ad-hoc date selection vs. pre-configured ranges) </li><li class="listitem">Desired execution speed of query (e.g., 90 seconds may be reasonable to some for an ad-hoc report, whereas it may be too long for others) </li></ul></div><p>
   ... and solutions are also influenced by the size of the cluster and how much processing power you have to throw at the solution.
   Common techniques are in sub-sections below.  This is a comprehensive, but not exhaustive, list of approaches.
  </p><p>It should not be a surprise that secondary indexes require additional cluster space and processing.
  This is precisely what happens in an RDBMS because the act of creating an alternate index requires both space and processing cycles to update.  RBDMS products
  are more advanced in this regard to handle alternative index management out of the box.  However, HBase scales better at larger data volumes, so this is a feature trade-off.
  </p><p>Pay attention to <a class="xref" href="#">???</a> when implementing any of these approaches.</p><p>Additionally, see the David Butler response in this dist-list thread <a class="link" href="http://search-hadoop.com/m/nvbiBp2TDP/Stargate%252Bhbase&amp;subj=Stargate+hbase" target="_top">HBase, mail # user - Stargate+hbase</a>

        We can store them in an HBase table called LOG_DATA, but what will the rowkey be?  
       From these attributes the rowkey will be some combination of hostname, timestamp, and log-event - but what specifically?        
      </p><div class="section" title="1.11.1.1.&nbsp;Timestamp In The Rowkey Lead Position"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="schema.casestudies.log-timeseries.tslead"></a>1.11.1.1.&nbsp;Timestamp In The Rowkey Lead Position</h4></div></div></div><p>The rowkey <code class="code">[timestamp][hostname][log-event]</code> suffers from the monotonically increasing rowkey problem

    Monotonically Increasing Row Keys/Timeseries Data
    &#8221;</a>.
        </p><p>There is another pattern frequently mentioned in the dist-lists about &#8220;bucketing&#8221; timestamps, by performing a mod operation 
        on the timestamp.  If time-oriented scans are important, this could be a useful approach.  Attention must be paid to the number
        of buckets, because this will require the same number of scans to return results.
</p><pre class="programlisting">
long bucket = timestamp % numBuckets;
</pre><p>
        &#8230; to construct:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
[bucket][timestamp][hostname][log-event]
</pre><p>        
          As stated above, to select data for a particular timerange, a Scan will need to be performed for each bucket.  100 buckets,
          for example, will provide a wide distribution in the keyspace but it will require 100 Scans to obtain data for a single
          timestamp, so there are trade-offs.

        the writes and reads across the keyspace.  This approach would be useful if scanning by hostname was a priority.
        </p></div><div class="section" title="1.11.1.3.&nbsp;Timestamp, or Reverse Timestamp?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="schema.casestudies.log-timeseries.revts"></a>1.11.1.3.&nbsp;Timestamp, or Reverse Timestamp?</h4></div></div></div><p>If the most important access path is to pull most recent events, then storing the timestamps as reverse-timestamps 
        (e.g., <code class="code">timestamp = Long.MAX_VALUE &#8211; timestamp</code>) will create the property of being able to do a Scan on
        <code class="code">[hostname][log-event]</code> to obtain the quickly obtain the most recently captured events.
        </p><p>Neither approach is wrong, it just depends on what is most appropriate for the situation.
        </p></div><div class="section" title="1.11.1.4.&nbsp;Variangle Length or Fixed Length Rowkeys?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="schema.casestudies.log-timeseries.varkeys"></a>1.11.1.4.&nbsp;Variangle Length or Fixed Length Rowkeys?</h4></div></div></div><p>It is critical to remember that rowkeys are stamped on every column in HBase.  If the hostname is &#8220;a&#8221; and the event type
         is &#8220;e1&#8221; then the resulting rowkey would be quite small.  However, what if the ingested hostname is
          &#8220;myserver1.mycompany.com&#8221; and the event type is &#8220;com.package1.subpackage2.subsubpackage3.ImportantService&#8221;?  
         </p><p>It might make sense to use some substitution in the rowkey.  There are at least two approaches:  hashed and numeric.
         In the Hostname In The Rowkey Lead Position example, it might look like this:
        </p><p>Composite Rowkey With Hashes:  
           </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">[MD5 hash of hostname] = 16 bytes</li><li class="listitem">[MD5 hash of event-type] = 16 bytes</li><li class="listitem">[timestamp] = 8 bytes</li></ul></div><p>
        </p><p>Composite Rowkey With Numeric Substitution: 
        </p><p>For this approach another lookup table would be needed in addition to LOG_DATA, called LOG_TYPES.  
        The rowkey of LOG_TYPES would be:
		  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">[type]  (e.g., byte indicating hostname vs. event-type)</li><li class="listitem">[bytes]  variable length bytes for raw hostname or event-type.</li></ul></div><p>
        A column for this rowkey could be a long with an assigned number, which could be obtained by using an 
		<a class="link" href="http://hbase.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/client/HTable.html#incrementColumnValue%28byte[],%20byte[],%20byte[],%20long%29" target="_top">HBase counter</a>.
        </p><p>So the resulting composite rowkey would be:
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">[substituted long for hostname] = 8 bytes</li><li class="listitem">[substituted long for event type] = 8 bytes</li><li class="listitem">[timestamp] = 8 bytes</li></ul></div><p>
		In either the Hash or Numeric substitution approach, the raw values for hostname and event-type can be stored as columns.
        </p></div></div><div class="section" title="1.11.2.&nbsp;Case Study - Log Data and Timeseries Data on Steroids"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="schema.casestudies.log-steroids"></a>1.11.2.&nbsp;Case Study - Log Data and Timeseries Data on Steroids</h3></div></div></div><p>This effectively is the OpenTSDB approach.  What OpenTSDB does is re-write data and pack rows into columns for 
        certain time-periods.  For a detailed explanation, see:  <a class="link" href="http://opentsdb.net/schema.html" target="_top">http://opentsdb.net/schema.html</a>,

	    from HBaseCon2012.
      </p><p>But this is how the general concept works:  data is ingested, for example, in this manner&#8230;
</p><pre class="programlisting">
[hostname][log-event][timestamp1]
[hostname][log-event][timestamp2]
[hostname][log-event][timestamp3]
</pre><p>
       &#8230; with separate rowkeys for each detailed event, but is re-written like this&#8230; 
       </p><p><code class="code">[hostname][log-event][timerange]</code>
       </p><p>&#8230; and each of the above events are converted into columns stored with a time-offset relative to the beginning timerange 
       (e.g., every 5 minutes).  This is obviously a very advanced processing technique, but HBase makes this possible.

There are two core record-types being ingested:  
        a Customer record type, and Order record type.
      </p><p>The Customer record type would include all the things that you&#8217;d typically expect:
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">Customer number</li><li class="listitem">Customer name</li><li class="listitem">Address (e.g., city, state, zip)</li><li class="listitem">Phone numbers, etc.</li></ul></div><p>
     </p><p>The Order record type would include things like:

           for details)</li></ul></div><p>
    </p><p>Assuming that the combination of customer number and sales order uniquely identify an order, these two attributes will compose
 the rowkey, and specifically a composite key such as:
    </p><p><code class="code">[customer number][order number]</code>
    </p><p>&#8230; for a ORDER table.  However, there are more design decisions to make:  are the <span class="emphasis"><em>raw</em></span> values the best choices for rowkeys?
    </p><p>The same design questions in the Log Data use-case confront us here.  What is the keyspace of the customer number, and what is the 
format (e.g., numeric?  alphanumeric?) As it is advantageous to use fixed-length keys in HBase, as well as keys that can support a 
reasonable spread in the keyspace, similar options appear:
    </p><p>Composite Rowkey With Hashes:  
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">[MD5 of customer number] = 16 bytes</li><li class="listitem">[MD5 of order number] = 16 bytes</li></ul></div><p>

            record types into a single table (e.g., CUSTOMER++).            
            </p><p>Customer Record Type Rowkey:

            </p><p>The advantage of this particular CUSTOMER++ approach is that organizes many different record-types by customer-id

            a particular record-type.

    		how to handle per-user list data in Apache HBase. 
    		</p><p>*** QUESTION ***</p><p>
    		We're looking at how to store a large amount of (per-user) list data in
HBase, and we were trying to figure out what kind of access pattern made
the most sense.  One option is store the majority of the data in a key, so
we could have something like:
    		</p><pre class="programlisting">
&lt;FixedWidthUserName&gt;&lt;FixedWidthValueId1&gt;:"" (no value)
&lt;FixedWidthUserName&gt;&lt;FixedWidthValueId2&gt;:"" (no value)
&lt;FixedWidthUserName&gt;&lt;FixedWidthValueId3&gt;:"" (no value)
			</pre>

The other option we had was to do this entirely using:
    		<pre class="programlisting">
&lt;FixedWidthUserName&gt;&lt;FixedWidthPageNum0&gt;:&lt;FixedWidthLength&gt;&lt;FixedIdNextPageNum&gt;&lt;ValueId1&gt;&lt;ValueId2&gt;&lt;ValueId3&gt;...
&lt;FixedWidthUserName&gt;&lt;FixedWidthPageNum1&gt;:&lt;FixedWidthLength&gt;&lt;FixedIdNextPageNum&gt;&lt;ValueId1&gt;&lt;ValueId2&gt;&lt;ValueId3&gt;...
    		</pre><p>
where each row would contain multiple values.
So in one case reading the first thirty values would be:
			</p><pre class="programlisting">
scan { STARTROW =&gt; 'FixedWidthUsername' LIMIT =&gt; 30}
    		</pre>
And in the second case it would be
    		<pre class="programlisting">
get 'FixedWidthUserName\x00\x00\x00\x00'
    		</pre><p>
The general usage pattern would be to read only the first 30 values of
these lists, with infrequent access reading deeper into the lists.  Some
users would have &lt;= 30 total values in these lists, and some users would
have millions (i.e. power-law distribution)
			</p><p>
 The single-value format seems like it would take up more space on HBase,
but would offer some improved retrieval / pagination flexibility.  Would
there be any significant performance advantages to be able to paginate via
gets vs paginating with scans?
			</p><p>
  My initial understanding was that doing a scan should be faster if our
paging size is unknown (and caching is set appropriately), but that gets
should be faster if we'll always need the same page size.  I've ended up
hearing different people tell me opposite things about performance.  I
assume the page sizes would be relatively consistent, so for most use cases
we could guarantee that we only wanted one page of data in the
fixed-page-length case.  I would also assume that we would have infrequent
updates, but may have inserts into the middle of these lists (meaning we'd
need to update all subsequent rows).
			</p><p>
Thanks for help / suggestions / follow-up questions.
			</p><p>*** ANSWER ***</p><p>
If I understand you correctly, you're ultimately trying to store
triples in the form "user, valueid, value", right? E.g., something
like:
			</p><pre class="programlisting">
"user123, firstname, Paul",
"user234, lastname, Smith"
			</pre><p>
(But the usernames are fixed width, and the valueids are fixed width).
			</p><p>
And, your access pattern is along the lines of: "for user X, list the
next 30 values, starting with valueid Y". Is that right? And these
values should be returned sorted by valueid?
			</p><p>
The tl;dr version is that you should probably go with one row per
user+value, and not build a complicated intra-row pagination scheme on
your own unless you're really sure it is needed.
			</p><p>
Your two options mirror a common question people have when designing
HBase schemas: should I go "tall" or "wide"? Your first schema is
"tall": each row represents one value for one user, and so there are
many rows in the table for each user; the row key is user + valueid,
and there would be (presumably) a single column qualifier that means
"the value". This is great if you want to scan over rows in sorted
order by row key (thus my question above, about whether these ids are
sorted correctly). You can start a scan at any user+valueid, read the
next 30, and be done. What you're giving up is the ability to have
transactional guarantees around all the rows for one user, but it
doesn't sound like you need that. Doing it this way is generally
recommended (see
here <a class="link" href="http://hbase.apache.org/book.html#schema.smackdown" target="_top">http://hbase.apache.org/book.html#schema.smackdown</a>).
			</p><p>
Your second option is "wide": you store a bunch of values in one row,
using different qualifiers (where the qualifier is the valueid). The
simple way to do that would be to just store ALL values for one user
in a single row. I'm guessing you jumped to the "paginated" version
because you're assuming that storing millions of columns in a single
row would be bad for performance, which may or may not be true; as
long as you're not trying to do too much in a single request, or do
things like scanning over and returning all of the cells in the row,
it shouldn't be fundamentally worse. The client has methods that allow
you to get specific slices of columns.
			</p><p>
Note that neither case fundamentally uses more disk space than the
other; you're just "shifting" part of the identifying information for
a value either to the left (into the row key, in option one) or to the
right (into the column qualifiers in option 2). Under the covers,
every key/value still stores the whole row key, and column family
name. (If this is a bit confusing, take an hour and watch Lars
George's excellent video about understanding HBase schema design:
<a class="link" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HLoH_PgrLk)" target="_top">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HLoH_PgrLk)</a>.
			</p><p>
A manually paginated version has lots more complexities, as you note,
like having to keep track of how many things are in each page,
re-shuffling if new values are inserted, etc. That seems significantly
more complex. It might have some slight speed advantages (or
disadvantages!) at extremely high throughput, and the only way to
really know that would be to try it out. If you don't have time to
build it both ways and compare, my advice would be to start with the
simplest option (one row per user+value). Start simple and iterate! :)
